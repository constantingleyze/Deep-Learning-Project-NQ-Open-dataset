# Deep-Learning-Project-NQ-Open-dataset

Since the introduction of the Transformers architecture in 2017, the way we understand Natural Language Processing has shifted. The GPT models by OpenAI and Llama by Meta are good at understanding and generating texts with a focus on different tasks, Llama is meant to deal with longer texts and has a more encyclopedic purpose.

In this project, we analyze the “exact match” performance of these models for the task of question answering, that is interpreting a question in natural language, searching information in a database and generating answers.
